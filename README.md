# Mozilla Presentation

## Introduction

As a mozillian, I give out presentation on various occasions from time to time, and I always use my own modified version of Harald Kirschner's html slide, which appears very cool and helpful.

Through this fork I maintain my own modification, keep contents up to date and hold historical changes. Currently it's in Chinese only.
